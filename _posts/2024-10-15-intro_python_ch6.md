# Keypoints

## 1.while loop
keeps on looping until the condition is false

use break statement to get out of a while loop

use continue to skip to the next iteration

# 2. For loops

can be used to iterate over strings,lists,tuples and dictionaries.

break and continue also applies to for loops the same it does in a while loop.

# 3. range()

range() returns a sequence of numbers within the specified range.

usage format: range(start,stop,step)

range() also returns an iterable object, which could be used in conjunction with for loops.

```python
for x in range(0,5)
    print(x)

#outputs 0,1,2,3,4
```

# 4. Other iterators

ch10 - iteration over user-defined objects
ch11 - itertools(a useful standard Python module)
ch14 - iteration over files
